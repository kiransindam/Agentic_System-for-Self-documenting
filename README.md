## Getting Started: End-to-End Local Setup

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: This is included with the Node.js installation.

### 2. Download the Project

First, download the project files. In a web-based IDE like Firebase Studio, you can typically find an **"Export to Zip"** or **"Download Project"** option in the file menu or explorer.

Once downloaded, unzip the project folder to your desired location.

### 3. Installation and Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change your directory to the project's root folder.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project-folder
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Run the following command to install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    The application uses the Gemini API for its AI features, which requires an API key.

    - Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root directory of your project.
    - Obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    - Add the API key to your `.env.local` file as shown below:

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    > **Note**: This file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to your repository to keep your API key secure.

### 4. Running the Application

Now you are ready to run the application locally.

1.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Execute the following command to start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command runs the app in development mode with Turbopack for faster performance.
2. **ðŸ”— Live Demonstration**

3.  **View the Application**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
    [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)

You should now see the "Coding Documentation" application running on your local machine!

## Available Scripts

In the `package.json` file, you will find several scripts for managing the application:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the application in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the application.
- `npm start`: Starts the application in production mode (requires a build to be run first).
- `npm run lint`: Lints the project files to check for code quality and style issues.
- `npm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
